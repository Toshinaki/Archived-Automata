# Automata
## the **Great Plan**

### Q1: What can be automated?
Boring things (which means everything):
- Boring settings on bussiness softwares / internet services
- Excel / Spreadsheet input
- Scrawling millions of website pages
- ...

### Q2: How? Automate by what?
I use python, so mainly be Python, with libraries like selenium, beautiful-soup etc.

Also, I'm familliar with Windows, so cmd batch or powershell.

And google scripts for google services

### Q3: Levels?
- Normal: for normal people who does not care about coding or anything and just want to see things be done
- Advanced: for geeks thoes who want to write their own codes

## Structures

### Basics
- HiveMind - Cute bees for multi-threading in Python
- udec - Useful decorators for logging, type-checking...

### User Interface
- command line based, interactive ui
- web page as ui (built with flask, or react?)
- desktop ui (QT, or electron?)

### Mode
- Online: share scripts with people, group or public; upload or download
- Offline: Just put scripts (.py or .csv or ...?) into local folder, and the level is determined by suffix


### For different missions
#### Forms
- Recommended: a spreadsheet or csv file contains xpaths for every input-able elements for reference
- Option:
    1. Normal: a spreadsheet or csv file with rows of steps for a certain operation
    2. Advanced: a python file implementing two functions: `rough_func` and `work_func` (for `HiveMind` using)
#### Uploading images/files (a branch of Forms, only more complicated)
#### Notification
Email, Slack, Redash...
#### Copy/Paste to csv-like
Python libraries (csv, gspread)
#### Crawling

## How to use
### Prerequisite
- For simple users: a moderate teammate
- For moderate users: basic HTML and xPath
- For advanced users: Python and all above

### Install (this is temporary)
1. Open the "installers" folder
2. For Windows users, right-click and run "_installer_for_Windows.ps1"
3. Follow the instruct and wait for the installation complete
4. After installation, there will be some icons show up in the root folder, each opens a different UI

### Command-line mode
